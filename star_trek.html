            <p>
                One of the most famous Star Trek locations, Vasquez Rocks
                appeared in The Original Series episode "Arena," where
                Captain Kirk battles the Gorn. The dramatic rock formations
                have been used repeatedly across multiple Trek series.

                Frequently shown in establishing shots of Starfleet Headquarters,

            <h2>Muir Woods National Monument in California</h2>
            <p>
                The towering redwoods of Muir Woods were used in
                Star Trek Into Darkness to depict an alien planet.
                The massive trees and filtered light give the forest
                a mystical, sci-fi feel.

            <h2>Point Mugu State Park in Malibu, CA</h2>
            <p>
                Several episodes of The Original Series used the dramatic
                cliffs and beaches of Point Mugu as alien landscapes.
                It’s one of the most reused outdoor filming locations
                from the 1960s series.
