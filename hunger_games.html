            <h2>District 12: Henry River Mill Village in North Carolina</h2>
            <p>
                This abandoned mill town served as District 12 in the first
                Hunger Games film. Fans can walk through the preserved
                buildings that became Katniss Everdeen’s home district.

            <h2>DuPont State Recreational Forest in North Carolina</h2>
            <p>
                Many arena scenes from the first film were shot here.
                The waterfalls and dense forest landscapes became
                the battleground where Katniss fought for survival.

            <h2>President Snow's Mansion: Swan House in Georgia</h2>
            <p>
                The Swan House served as President Snow’s mansion in
                Catching Fire. Its grand columns and sweeping staircase
                perfectly capture the Capitol’s wealth and power.

            <h2>Training Center: Atlanta Marriott Marquis</h2>
            <p>
                The dramatic futuristic atrium of this hotel in Georgia was used as
                part of the Capitol’s Tribute Training Center in Catching Fire.
                Its massive interior architecture feels straight out of Panem.

            <p>
                The beach arena scenes in Catching Fire were filmed here.
                The park’s lake and surrounding forest became part of the
                Quarter Quell battleground.
