            <h2>Mystic Falls: Covington, GA</h2>
            <p>
                Although Mystic Falls is fictional, most of the show was filmed
                in Covington, Georgia. The charming town square serves as the
                heart of Mystic Falls and appears throughout the entire series.
                Fans can visit many recognizable spots right in the downtown area.

            <h2>The Salvatore Boarding House: Covington, GA</h2>
            <p>
                The iconic Salvatore mansion exterior was filmed at Glenridge Hall
                in Sandy Springs, Georgia (now demolished). Later seasons used
                other properties and studio sets to recreate the grand estate.
                It remains one of the most recognizable locations from the series.

                Caroline Forbes’ home, where she lives with her mom Sheriff Liz Forbes,
